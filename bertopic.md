# YouTube Creator Insights — Week 7 & 8 Progress
**Project:** Purdue Industry Practicum (PYI)
**Date:** February 25, 2026
**Sprint Focus:** Data Pipeline Completion → BERTopic Model Training → Dashboard Shell

---

## Overview

This document covers all work completed in the current sprint session, spanning the tail end of Week 6 through Week 7 and the start of Week 8. The session took the project from raw category CSVs through a fully merged, cleaned, and preprocessed dataset, and completed BERTopic model training with validated output.

---

## Week 6 Completion — Data Cleaning & EDA (PYI-3)

**Status: Complete — mark Done in Jira.**

### Merge (`scripts/merge_datasets.py`)

Consolidated the six category CSVs into `data/processed/combined_videos_raw.csv`.

**Duplicate handling:**

- **Within-file duplicates** — Gaming, entertainment, food, and tech each contained videos scraped on multiple snapshot dates. Resolved by keeping the latest snapshot per `video_id`.
- **Cross-category duplicates** — 250 video_ids appeared in both `research_science` and `tech` (Ben Eater, Computerphile, Practical Engineering, Real Engineering, Two Minute Papers). Resolved by reassigning all five channels to `research_science` (more specific label) before deduplication.

**Final merged dataset:** 29,702 rows → 28,037 unique videos across 461 channels.

| Category | Videos | Channels |
|---|---|---|
| research_science | 6,779 | 40 |
| entertainment | 4,690 | 99 |
| tech | 4,294 | 92 |
| food | 4,126 | 87 |
| gaming | 4,093 | 59 |
| fitness | 4,055 | 84 |

---

### EDA (`notebooks/exploratory/02_eda_youtube_metadata.ipynb`)

9 cells, all executed. Figures saved to `outputs/figures/`.

| Cell | Content |
|---|---|
| 1 | Imports, load, type casting, duration parsing |
| 2 | Dataset overview — null rates, videos/channels per category, Shorts counts |
| 3 | View count distribution (log scale) + median views by category |
| 4 | Engagement metrics — like rate and comment rate by category |
| 5 | Duration distribution — long-form histogram + median duration by category |
| 6 | Channel-level stats — subscribers vs median views scatter, top 10 channels |
| 7 | Publishing volume per quarter by category (2020–2026) |
| 8 | Text field coverage — BERTopic readiness by category |
| 9 | Data quality flag summary |

**Key findings:**
- Shorts are 22.8% of all videos; fitness (35.6%) and food (31.9%) most short-form heavy
- 29% of videos have no tags; fitness worst at 40.1%
- 2,426 videos have neither description nor tags — title only for BERTopic
- Top channels by median views: MrBeast Gaming (47.6M), Mark Rober (24.4M), NileRed (11.6M)

---

### Preprocessing (`notebooks/modeling/03_bertopic_experiments.ipynb`, Cells 1–8)

| Cell | Content |
|---|---|
| 1 | Imports, load `combined_videos_raw.csv`, type casting |
| 2 | Drop unusable rows — 37 dropped (1 null views, 36 unparseable durations) |
| 3 | Derive engagement features: `like_rate`, `comment_rate`, `views_per_day`, `publish_year`, `publish_month` |
| 4 | Text cleaning — strip URLs, hashtags, @mentions, emoji, punctuation from title/description/tags |
| 5 | Build `bertopic_text` — title doubled + description + tags; flag sparse docs (< 5 tokens) |
| 6 | Drop 26 low-value columns (thumbnail URLs/dimensions, redundant IDs, low-signal booleans) |
| 7 | Save three output files |
| 8 | Preprocessing summary |

**bertopic_text strategy:**
```
bertopic_text = title_clean + " " + title_clean + " " + desc_clean + " " + tags_clean
```
Title doubled to upweight it relative to the longer description.

**Text coverage in final corpus (28,000 docs):**

| Coverage | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| Title + description + tags | 19,740 | 70.5% |
| Title + description only | 5,512 | 19.7% |
| Title + tags only | 166 | 0.6% |
| Title only | 2,426 | 8.7% |
| Sparse (< 5 tokens) | 182 | 0.7% |

**Outputs:** `combined_videos_clean.csv` (28,000 × 42), `bertopic_corpus.txt` (28,000 lines), `bertopic_metadata.csv` (28,000 × 12)

## Week 7 — BERTopic Model Training (PYI-84)

**Status: Complete — mark Done in Jira.**

### Environment Setup

BERTopic is not available on conda defaults. Required a fresh environment:

```bash
conda create -n youtube-ip python=3.11
conda activate youtube-ip
pip install bertopic sentence-transformers umap-learn hdbscan jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name youtube-ip --display-name "youtube-ip"
```

**Why Python 3.11:** The base environment (Python 3.12) triggers a `ForwardRef._evaluate()` TypeError via a `langsmith` → `pydantic.v1` chain imported by BERTopic's LangChain backend. Python 3.11 avoids this entirely.

**Issue encountered:** Cell 10 (component model assembly) was accidentally saved as a Markdown cell instead of Code. This caused `NameError: name 'embedding_model' is not defined` in Cell 12, and cells 12–15 all failed. Fixed by changing the cell type back to Code and rerunning from Cell 10.

### PYI-87 — Implement Training Notebook (Cells 9–11)

**Cell 9 — Imports & Config**

| Constant | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `RANDOM_STATE` | 42 | Reproducibility |
| `MIN_TOPIC_SIZE` | 30 | Min videos per topic |
| `N_GRAM_RANGE` | (1, 2) | Unigrams + bigrams |
| `TOP_N_WORDS` | 10 | Keywords per topic |

**Cell 10 — Component Models**

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Embedding model | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Fast, lightweight, strong semantic quality for short-to-medium text |
| UMAP | `n_neighbors=15, n_components=5, metric=cosine` | 5 components before HDBSCAN (not 2 — that's visualization only) |
| HDBSCAN | `min_cluster_size=30, eom, prediction_data=True` | `prediction_data=True` required for `transform()` on new docs later |
| Vectorizer | `CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2), stop_words=english, min_df=5, max_df=0.85)` | Bigrams improve keyword quality |
| Representation | `KeyBERTInspired()` | Refines c-TF-IDF labels using embedding similarity |

### PYI-89 — Validate Model Output (Cell 13)

**Outlier rate: 30%**

**Topic size distribution (118 topics, excl. outliers):**

| Stat | Value |
|---|---|
| Mean | 148.7 videos |
| Median | 54.5 videos |
| Min | 32 videos |
| Max | 2,529 videos |
| Topics < 50 videos | 41 |

**Category coherence:**
- Median dominant-category share: **0.97** — topics are almost entirely single-category
- 105 of 118 topics are >80% one category
- Only 2 topics are cross-category (≤50% dominant share)

This is a strong signal. The model is finding real semantic clusters within categories rather than blending unrelated niches.

**Spot-check (3 random topics):**

- **Topic 45** (fallout season, prime video, amazon prime) → TV/streaming content breakdown and review videos ✓
- **Topic 6** (verge, tech news, vergecast) → Contains some mismatches (self-hosted Nextcloud, Arduino) suggesting this topic is slightly broad
- **Topic 116** (kurzgesagt, bird army, voice) → Clean Kurzgesagt cluster ✓
